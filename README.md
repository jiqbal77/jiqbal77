## 🚀 About Me

Hi, I'm Junaid 👋
I'm a web developer passionate about building apps that people actually use. Over the years, I've worked on a variety of projects—from e-commerce platforms to a real-time car auction system where users could place live bids. There's nothing quite like seeing something you've built being used in the real world.

Lately, I've been focused on leveling up my skills. I'm diving into advanced React patterns, exploring microservices architecture, and experimenting with cloud deployment to make applications faster and more reliable. I love trying out new tools and finding smarter ways to solve problems.

Most of the time, you'll find me deep in code—debugging, building features, or testing new ideas. I definitely get stuck sometimes (who doesn’t?), but I enjoy the challenge of figuring things out. Honestly, I even catch myself thinking about code when I’m off the clock—or dreaming about debugging sessions 😅.

At the core of it, I just love building, learning, and sharing what I discover along the way.
